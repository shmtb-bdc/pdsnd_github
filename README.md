## Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project was completed as part of the Udacity Introduction to Python course, within the Introduction to Programming for Data Science nanodegree program. The project required creation of Python code to import, clean, and organize data; gather user inputs; and display descriptive statistics based on user selections.

### Files used
The files used include three .csv source files with city-specific data:
-chicago.csv
-washington.csv
-new_york_city.csv

In addition, the bikeshare3.py file contains the Python code created for the project.

### Credits
I used the Python Standard Library (https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html), the Pandas user guide (https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html), and Udacity course materials for this project. Oops! I forgot that I also consulted _Python for Data Analysis_ by Wes McKinney.
